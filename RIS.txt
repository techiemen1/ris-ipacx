RIS

✅ What’s Solid
📁 /controller/

    auditController.js, authController.js, userController.js — clear separation of concerns.

    Good naming convention. Suggest adding adminController.js if you plan to manage users or roles.

📁 /db/

    index.js likely holds your pg.Pool config — perfect.

    If you’re scaling, consider adding migration.js or integrating with tools like node-pg-migrate.

📁 /middleware/

    authMiddleware.js — great for JWT verification.

    Consider adding roleMiddleware.js for granular access control (e.g., admin, radiologist, technician).

📁 /models/

    userModel.js — good start. If you expand to audit logs, consider adding auditModel.js for reusable queries.

📁 /routes/

    auditRoutes.js, authRoutes.js, userRoutes.js — clean routing.

    auth.js and UserProfile.js seem out of place — are they route handlers or components? Consider renaming or relocating.

📁 /utils/

    jwt.js — perfect for token generation and verification.

    You might add logger.js for centralized logging, especially for audit trails.

📁 /uploads/

    profile_pics/ — good start. Make sure you validate file types and sanitize filenames.

    Consider adding uploads/audit_exports/ if you plan to support CSV or PDF exports.
